# Setting Up own MCP Server using Python

Installation
Adding MCP to your python project
We recommend using uv to manage your Python projects.

https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/


If you haven't created a uv-managed project yet, create one:

    uv init mcp-server-demo1
    cd mcp-server-demo1

Then add MCP to your project dependencies: 

    uv add "mcp[cli]"

Running the standalone MCP development tools
To run the mcp command with uv:

    uv run mcp

# Create an MCP Server to add two numbers  

Create main.py and add the code present in it.

# Install the Claude desktop and add the configuration as below in it: 

    Add the claude_desktop_config,json in Claude desktop
